Welcome to Continous Learning – a space where various computing projects come to life. I am a DevOps Engineer, and created this blog to just host personal projects and interests.

Rather than being a tutorial site, this blog focuses on real-world projects - how they were built, the challenges faced, and the thought process behind them. Each post dives into the design, implementation, and lessons learned, giving insight into how different technologies come together to solve real problems.
